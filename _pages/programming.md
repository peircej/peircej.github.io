## Programming

Although I'm paid by University of Nottingham first and foremost to do research and teach, the thing I'm best known for is my work on experimental methods, specifically, in writing the [http://www.psychopy.org](PsychoPy free easy software for psychology experiments).

PsychoPy offers a unique combination of interfaces, allowing you to create code in a really simple visual interface, with a flow diagram and dialog boxes to control stimuli, and a Python library for those that want to hand-code scripts in the powerful _Python_ programming language.

All of this (many years of work and over 140,000 lines of code) is open source
and free[^free] for everyone.

[^free]: Free as in beer and free as in speech (no charge and do what you like)

PsychoPy has become the software package of choice in labs and undergraduate classrooms all over the World, with over 20,000 monthly users.
