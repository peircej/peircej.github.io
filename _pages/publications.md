## Publications

### Journal Articles

I could keep a list here, but it's really easier if you go to
[Jon Peirce on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=DBHYcLQAAAAJ&hl=en)

### Books

- [Building Experiments in PsychoPy](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/building-experiments-in-psychopy/book253480)
(Peirce and MacAskill) is due for release in May 2018 with
Sage Publishing. This book is suitable as a textbook to support undergraduate
lab classes or as a reference manual for experienced researchers, including those
using neuroimaging, psychophysics and eye-trackin techniques. As the name
suggests, this really focusses on the graphical _Builder_ interface although we
do introduce Python programming, increasingly through the book, to support more
advanced studies.

- _Programming Experiments in Python_, is hopefully going to be available in November
2018, also with Sage Publishing, covering the programming interface.
